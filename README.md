# Portfolio-1
First Basic Website,
This website is just a basic website of everything i know and eventually i will be updating it to be more responsive and look like a professional page that will show case all my other projects.

Most of the code that i am using in this project is mostly HTML and CSS but later on i will be implementing javascript.

This is the link to the page thats in this repository:
